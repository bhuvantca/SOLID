The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, and it states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or job.

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, and it states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to your code without changing existing code.

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, named after computer scientist Barbara Liskov. It states that objects of a derived class must be substitutable for objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, if you have a base class and you create a derived class from it, you should be able to use objects of the derived class wherever you use objects of the base class.

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, a class should not be required to implement methods it does not need. The principle emphasizes that interfaces should be designed in a way that is specific to the needs of the clients that use them, rather than being overly broad and forcing clients to implement unnecessary methods.

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It suggests two main things:
      High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
      Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
      In other words, DIP encourages a design where the high-level and low-level components interact with each other through abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes), reducing the coupling between them.
